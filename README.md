TEXT ADVENTURE!
(Medium Difficulty)
Choose your own path! Make your
own choices! The possibilities are
limitless with text adventures.
Using many, many "if" statements
and "System.out.print"s, I can
craft an adventure in which the
endings can vary. Have fun!

   INSTRUCTIONS (PLEASE READ)
This game runs only in a 155
character or wider terminal / soft 
wrapping compiler. It's ideal that
the text is single spaced, though not
necessary (if using Repl.it, move the
bars that adjust the size of the windows
to the left so that the only visible
thing on the screen is the terminal).
 
When the "GAME OVER" screen shows
up, the explanation to your death
is above that screen (you must
scroll up). You really should read
them so that the story makes sense.

Also, the words on the title screen say:
LAND OF HISTOLIA - TYPE "S" TO START
(in case it was not very legible).
Also, what I should have said was
"TYPE S AND PRESS ENTER TO START".
Sorry. :/

SPECIAL THANKS TO:
ASCII-ART-GENERATOR.ORG
This project never would have been
finished without it.

And thank you for playing! Have fun!
